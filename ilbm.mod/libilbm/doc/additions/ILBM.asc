CRNG

By accident (after examining a large number of images that support color
cycling), I discovered that in some cases the colors in the palette shift right,
and in others, left.

It turns out that for the images in which the colors shift left, the value of
the active field is 1. The active field is 3 when the colors shift to the right.

From this information, I believe that the least significant bit is the
enable/disable flag, and the next bit is used to determine whether to shift left
(0) or shift right (1).

This explains why the value is 3 (in base-2: 11) for cycle ranges that should
shift right -- 01 for enabling it + 10 for the right shift property.
